# QKP_Rollout
## Introduction
This repository presents a rollout method for constrained dynamic programming, applied to the 0-1 Quadratic Knapsack Problem (QKP).

## Data
Data for this project is generated using the standard scheme for testing algorithms designed for solving the 0-1 QKP. Particularly, ...
